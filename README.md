# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator â€“ Numerical Approximation

This project is a Python implementation of a quantum harmonic oscillator confined in a potential well. It computes and visualizes energy levels, eigenstates, and compares numerical results to analytical models.

## Features

- Numerical construction of the reduced Hamiltonian matrix
- Diagonalization to extract eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
- Plotting of:
  - Potential energy curves
  - Basis functions and their products
  - Energy spectrum
  - Wavefunctions
- Comparison with theoretical energy levels and quadratic models

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Install them via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
